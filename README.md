# League Of Legends - Data Analysis

Aim: Analyse League of Legends game data from 2014 till 2021 to identify different strategies the winning teams adopted over the time.
Data Source: Oracle's Elixir is a premier source for advanced esports statistics, which is used by broadcasters, professional team coaches, analysts, fantasy competitors, many fans across the world (2). Their data is a collection of match data from worldâ€™s top championship leagues such as
1. League of Legends Championship Series (LCS)
2. League of Legends European Championship (LEC)
3. League of Legends Champions Korea (LCK)
4. League of Legends Pro League (LPL) <br >

To extract team win strategies over the past few years, we need to extract team performance data from each year and then extract winning cases from them, to ultimately find a pattern in the team actions that lead to maximum wins. Following are the steps we follow to extract the cases, with maximum win possibility.


## Observations

After analysing data from 2014 to 2021, following are few key insights I got to observe.
1. Total no of rows in the data set is 57708 of which 9584 rows have a team stat and of them 9517 rows have a known team name.
2. 396 different teams have competed in one of the competitive leagues in 2021 so far.
3. Win percentage of a blue team is always more than the Red Team, average win percentage
for red team is 45.72 over the past eight years.
4. Heralds were first released in patch 5.22 which was released on 11th Nov 2015 (3). Heralds started to impact the game strategies ever since.
5. Winning the first baron, first tower, first mid-tower and first to three towers consistently, gave teams a winning edge over the opposition.
6. Winning the First Blood, First Dragon and First Herald in the game also significantly improved winning chances but comparatively winning First Baron, First Tower, First Mid Tower and First to Three Towers improve winning chances.
